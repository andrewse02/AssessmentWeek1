// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is when the team analyzes the idea, and determines what might be required to complete it. This may include hosting, third-party libraries, and other resources."
const design = "This is the beginning of the development process. The team starts to map out a basic structure of the program and begins to work on how it will be developed."
const implementation = "Programming starts. THe developers get to work on implementing the ideas that the design team and project managers came up with."
const testingAndIntegration = "QA Testers and DevOps begin to validate the integrity of what has been built, and integrates it into backend services and deploys it for additional testing or release."
const maintain = "The product has been completed, but the work is never fully done. As changes to software are constant, as must be the work to allow the product to fuction corrrectly. New updates may also be apart of this process."
